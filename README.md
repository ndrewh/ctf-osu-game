osu?
======

This is a CTF challenge I wrote for BuckeyeCTF 2022.

Summary
====

The files distributed are in dist/dist-osu-v2.zip

In this challenge, you can click notes which are (roughly) timed with music.
There is flag checking logic implemented in an OpenGL shader. The checker consists
of a set of VM programs which check some small property of the inputted sequence.

Full writeup [here](https://ctf.andrewh.tech/2022/buckeyectf-osu/).

```

Can you beat my super cool rhythm game?

./osu game.beatmap


if you have a recording you can do:

./osu game.beatmap game.recording
```


Audio
=====

If you want audio you need a SoundFont (SF2) file. You can get a nice one here from this Debian package:

http://deb.debian.org/debian/pool/main/f/fluid-soundfont/fluid-soundfont_3.1.orig.tar.gz

Place it in the current directory named 'FluidR3_GM.sf2'.
